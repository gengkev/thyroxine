thyroxine
=========

Unofficial Android client for TJ Iodine. Currently in development. There's a lot to be done!

Check out the wiki to the right! There's a [roadmap of features](https://github.com/gengkev/thyroxine/wiki/Roadmap).

Also you should probably also check out [Iolite](https://github.com/el1t/Iolite) which is pretty cool.

If you would like to contribute feel free to do so or just shoot me an email whenever :c

Help improve the super rad [Iodine API documentation](https://github.com/gengkev/thyroxine/wiki/Iodine-API-Documentation) on the wiki! It's getting kind of long, which is annoying. Probably because too much ranting. But it's still better than scouring the Iodine source code.
