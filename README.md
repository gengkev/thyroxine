thyroxine
=========

Unofficial Android client for TJ Iodine. Currently in development. There's a lot to be done! See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/gengkev/thyroxine/wiki/Roadmap).

You should probably also check out [Iolite](https://github.com/el1t/Iolite) which is pretty cool, and despite its shortfalls, it's a lot more usable at the moment.

I wrote the unofficial [iodine-api-docs](https://github.com/gengkev/iodine-api-docs), which started on this wiki. But now it looks like we're moving to Ion, which does have a nicer api (#18), but requires re-implementing tons of stuff.
